                        <p>Hi, I guess you want to know a little about me and what I do both 
    in, and out of, the band. For a starter I'm responsible for the
    programming/creation of this web-page - many a long hour has gone
    into this page. Within the band I play the drums, although at the 
    moment we're getting into sampling and I'm doing the programming 
    /sampling for the band. I have been playing for around three years 
    and still consider myself to be a beginner. My drum set is a "Mapex 
    mars pro series" (ex Gravey - thanks Phil), a pearl 13*3 piccalo 
    brass shell snare, and an assortment of 'Sabian' 'Zildjian' and 'Paiste'
    cymbals' . My musical tastes vary ( I know everyone says that) from 
    some classical and jazz, techno, industrial, hard core rock bands and 
    metal - basically anything except the top 40 style of shit. Here are 
    some favourites: Tool, Portishead, Iron maiden, Headless chickens, 
    Helmet, Skinny puppy, Cure, Nine Inch Nails and so on. Outside of 
    the band I'm a student at Massey university studying computer 
    science and psychology. I'm now in my third year and will finish (I 
    hope) at the end of this year. Before I went to uni I worked for 
    about five years, but I got bored of work - so I left... </p>
