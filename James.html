              One thing I've learnt about being involved in music is that there's usually nothing special or out of the ordinary about the individuals belonging to a band. As far as I'm concerned you're either involved with music because you can't live without playing music and you have found some higher purpose in playing music other than purely selfish reasons or because you want to live the rock god dream.
            </p>
            <p>
              For those people out there who aren't clear on living the rock god dream, it is simply when you play music under delusions of grandeur, i.e., you believe it will gain you fame and fortune. Perhaps you're thinking that in order to be successful in this field you must believe in both these ideals. Maybe this is the case, but in my experience selfless and selfish behavior don't seem to mix very well, and if you have tendencies towards both types you'll find that selfish behavior will dominate over the other as your belief in your success increases.

              If the future for Wholesale becomes more secure, I hope that my attitudes aren't governed by selfish behavior because I know our group is exactly as the word impliesâ€”a group, not a mixture of individuals all trying to freelance their way to the top. No member of Wholesale can do what they do without the input and influence of all the other members. With this in mind, I believe that an individual account of myself would be irrelevant.
