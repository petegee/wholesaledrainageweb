              To understand Wholesale is to understand a myriad of small features and quirks that combined make up the complete entity that is Wholesale Drainage. These features must be experienced personally in order for you to form your own mental picture that is correct for you; not forming an incomplete, and therefore twisted, view based upon blindly accepting what is force-fed through mediums such as this (what is indeed generally the case for popular music at large).

              As to why I play guitar for wholesale, I do so to satisfy some deep-seated urge to channel my own brand of power into the mighty behemoth that is Wholesale drainage.
